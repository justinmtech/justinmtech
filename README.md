Hi, I’m Justin! 

I'm a Software Developer with 3 years of experience.
My latest role was as the Lead Game Developer at TipsyCoin (https://tipsycoin.io).
Currently I am freelancing and searching for a full-time role as a developer since that project was finished.

I used to run ConspiracyCraft, which was a Minecraft server home to 250k unique players over its lifespan (2013-2020).
