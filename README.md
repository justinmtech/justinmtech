Hi, I’m Justin! 

I'm a Software Developer with 3 years of experience programming, and 8 years of experience making online games.
My previous role was as the Lead Game Developer at TipsyCoin (https://tipsycoin.io).
Currently I am freelancing and searching for a full-time role as a developer since that project is finished.

I also created and managed ConspiracyCraft, a Minecraft server that was played by 250,000 unique players over its lifespan (2013-2020).
You can check it out here: https://conspiracycraft.net. 

I'm based in the US and enjoy nice bike rides, old runescape soundtracks, learning new things and building cool software! 

Feel free to say hi or reach out with a business proposal!
