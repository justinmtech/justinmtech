Hi, I’m Justin! 

I'm a Game Developer @ [Affinity Development](https://twitter.com/affinitydev_). Currently I'm working on a new Minecraft project called Zen Survival. It's a completely custom upcoming Survival RPG with Guilds, Stats, Runes and more! https://discord.gg/T9ATFU7Zhs

I created and managed ConspiracyCraft, a Minecraft server that was played by 250,000 unique players over its lifespan (2013-2020).
You can check it out here: https://conspiracycraft.net. After a break from the community, I felt called back, so here I am!

I'm based in the US and enjoy nice bike rides, old runescape soundtracks, learning new things and building cool software.
