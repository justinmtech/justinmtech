- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Justin! I've been developing software for the past 3 years. 
- I have a long history working in the Minecraft field as a game developer @ConsiracyCraft.
- Currently I am freelancing in the space and searching for a full-time role.
- Java is my favorite language and I prefer backend work, but know some frontend as well.
